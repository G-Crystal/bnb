We will ask you to provide us their flight number in order to stay updated of their flight status. If your guests will arrive by train, plan an arrival 1 hour later.<br>
                                                Don't forget to recommend a bar or pub near to your property where they can wait in case of an early arrival. Don't worry, our keepers are always extremely punctual, if not early.

                                                Don't worry! Your keeper will wait for your guests up to 45 minutes after the time that you set when you had booked the service. The keeper will be in touch with your guests to confirm their arrival time.

                                                If their delay had been notified to us with enough time in advance (more than 6 hours prior booking time), we will organize ourselves to postpone the guest's Check-in time. If we are notified with not enough time by either you or your guests, we will be in contact with them to rearrange their reception.

                                                The prices that are offered on the site can vary depending on some factors. To receive the lowest cost, it is recommended that you reserve these services more than 72 hours in advance (between the time of reservation and the date of the service) and the service will be provided between 7am and 7pm.

                                                If the service is required after 7pm or before 7am, an additional NIGHT charge will be applied depending on the time specified.

                                                Likewise, if the reservation is made between 72 and 6 hours in advance, an additional LAST MINUTE charge will be applied. Extra charges apply as well for Sundays and Public holidays.
                                                These additional charges are cumulative.

                                                - closing windows<br>
                                                - turning off lights and heaters<br>
                                                - closing and locking your door<br>

                                                The prices that are offered on the site can vary depending on some factors. To receive the lowest cost, it is recommended that you reserve these services more than 72 hours in advance (between the time of reservation and the date of the service) and the service will be provided between 7am and 7pm.
                                                <br>
                                                If the service is required after 7pm or before 7am, an additional NIGHT charge will be applied depending on the time specified.
                                                <br>
                                                Likewise, if the reservation is made between 72 and 6 hours in an additional LAST MINUTE charge will be applied. Extra charges apply as well for Sundays and Public holidays.
                                                These additional charges are cumulative.

                                                For your first booking, we will come at yours to receive your instructions and pick-up the keys. We'll simply ask you for a 4 hours availability at any Sydney address; it could be your property address or at your office. As soon as we receive your keys, we will help you by answering all of your questions and help you to fill out your apartment form with all the necessary information to welcome your guests and prepare your property. You can select the date and time of your choice for this appointment directly online.

                                                Before the arrival of the customer service member: 
                                                - It is advisable to prepare two set of keys: one for your guests during their stay, and another for the BNB keeper team to keep it safe in case of emergency. If your guests loose the keys, lock themselves out, or got robbed (hopefully none of these happen!): we could be there to open the door!
                                                <br><br>
                                                - Start to think of what is important to you regarding your guests’ welcome, and do not forget to fill in the form about how the oven works, where we can find extra towels, where the nearest bistro is, where the vacuum cleaner is, etc...

                                                We will keep them safely for you and for the next services you might book. In that case, please leave also a second set of keys for the guests in your apartment.
